//well, FirebaseVisionText has these exacty  - store coords : map of (coords, block's text) pairs
	text.getText(), RectF rect = new RectF(text.getBoundingBox()); rect.left
//Nope, seems to crash coz of high rate?!-  First display the candidate text immediately
// show concatenated filtered text into vehicle number
POST ISSUES ONLINE-
//jsoup
//(solved) firebase

// TUNE OPENCV PARAMS
//Add drawer and clean the top boxes
//back button confirm 
	-> **make it into boilerplate along with simple permissions handler**

//>Debug bitmap reading on firebase	=> It was synchronization issue, isProcessing isn't good as it waits on main thread. But why'd it not run the task ever?!

// Nope, now can actually remove it for new url! - Improve captcha image processing

// Fix Fetching 
	// >> Get the ultimate tool : background Webview automated using simple js.
		https://github.com/daandtu/android-web-scraper/
	//	>Show layout webview in drawer until captcha is downloaded/ form is submitted

// EVEN BETTER IP -
	//> use only thresholding and a kernel to patch gray or white acc to surrounding

> Add some js to crop view instead of scraping vehicle details?! <- more versatile
 	^^> This is actually better for demo - should look like google assistant

Optimizations
	> Proper threaded listeners for captcha handling
	> Disable drawableCache in the webscraper.

** The new url doesn't need IP! opencv no more needed :)
Turbo mode - like QR scanner
	> Instant try to get vehicle info whenever valid number plate found
	> Open confirmation drawer immediately if details found.
	> otherwise wait for better input
